#### Abstract

We propose a manifold optimization approach for solving constrained inference and planning problems. The approach employs a framework that transforms an arbitrary nonlinear equality constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained manifold optimization problem. The core of the transformation process is the formulation of constraint manifolds that represent sets of variables subject to equality constraints. We propose various approaches to define the tan-gent spaces and retraction operations of constraint manifolds, which are crucial for manifold optimization. We evaluate our constraint manifold optimization approach on multiple constrained inference and planning problems, and show that it generates strictly feasible results with increased efficiency as compared to state-of-the-art constrained optimization methods.
