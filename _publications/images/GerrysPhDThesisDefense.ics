 ntinually pushed their crafts to embody the furthest reaches of human capa
 bilities\, from delicate painting to athletic performances\, highlighting 
 the potential for robots to emulate these skills. This work aims to study 
 the task of robot graffiti painting in three parts: rendering\, replicatin
 g\, and adapting human motions\, ultimately contributing to the fields of 
 robot art\, cable robot control\, motion planning\, and generative modelin
 g.\n\nIn this work\, three parts to the problem of artistic painting guide
 d by human motions are addressed: rendering a digital artwork in paint wit
 h a cable robot\; replicating human input motions as closely as possible\;
  and adapting human input motions to accommodate for differences in level 
 of detail\, style\, and artistic medium. Through the difficult\, interacti
 on-rich task of robot art\, modern challenges in human-robot collaboration
  can be studied. In particular\, techniques for robot motion control throu
 gh natural input interfaces drawn from human motions are developed. Render
 ing paint requires advances in state estimation and control techniques for
  fast\, fluid motions on a cable robot. Replicating human motions bridges 
 the input motions and robot kino-dynamic capabilities\, requiring advances
  in optimal trajectory retiming techniques. Finally\, adapting goes beyond
  rote replication by augmenting input motions to better fit the compositio
 n\, style\, and medium intended by the robot-artist team\, requiring embod
 iment-specific painting motion generation and sketch retargeting. Put toge
 ther\, the thesis forms a cohesive body of work producing human-robot pain
 tings and making novel contributions to the fields of robot art\, human-rob
 ot collaboration\, and cable robot control.\n
