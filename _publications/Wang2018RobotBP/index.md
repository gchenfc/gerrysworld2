#### Abstract

In order to conduct many desirable functions, service robots will need to actuate buttons and switches that are designed for humans. This paper presents the design of a robot named SwitchIt that is small, relatively inexpensive, easily mounted on a mobile robot, and actuates buttons reliably. Its operating characteristics were developed after conducting a systematic study of buttons and switches in human environments. From this study, we develop a categorization of buttons based on a set of physical properties relevant for robots to operate them. After a human calibrates and annotates buttons in the robot's environment using a hand-held tablet, the system automatically recognizes, pushes, and detects the state of a variety of buttons. Empirical tests demonstrate that the system succeeds in operating 95.7% of 234 total buttons/switches in an office building and a household environment.
