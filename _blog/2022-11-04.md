I was curious about what contributes most to food waste so I googled it and stumbled upon [this site](https://foodprint.org/issues/the-problem-of-food-waste/).  Very frustratingly, the numbers were buried in text and not in percentages, so I just compiled the numbers and put it into a pie chart.

# Google Sheets
I generated the pie chart in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gBppY0UYWwZGZULIQejPHp354bThsPj1Zqn_UyWBJ-k/edit?usp=sharing).  Here's the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSp1CfcOHAq99ouDgKfozaq5Bz024VD6S4g8uXa4c_2HnBqvm96SH2H3FtABwfZGOyKt6Zir6hiFX4K/pubhtml) and an interactive chart.  Note that, when you mouseover, the units are in billions of lbs.
