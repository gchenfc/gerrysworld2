@article{breath,
	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are important greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and have large impacts on Earth's radiative forcing and climate. Their natural and anthropogenic emissions have often been in focus, while the role of human metabolic emissions has received less attention. In this study, exhaled, dermal and whole-body CO2 and CH4 emission rates from a total of 20 volunteers were quantified under various controlled environmental conditions in a climate chamber. The whole-body CO2 emissions increased with temperature. Individual differences were the most important factor for the whole-body CH4 emissions. Dermal emissions of CO2 and CH4 only contributed ~3.5% and ~5.5% to the whole-body emissions, respectively. Breath measurements conducted on 24 volunteers in a companion study identified one third of the volunteers as CH4 producers (exhaled CH4 exceeded 1 ppm above ambient level). The exhaled CH4 emission rate of these CH4 producers (4.03 $\pm$ 0.71 mg/h/person, mean $\pm$ one standard deviation) was ten times higher than that of the rest of the volunteers (non-CH4 producers; 0.41 $\pm$ 0.45 mg/h/person). With increasing global population and the expected large reduction in global anthropogenic carbon emissions in the next decades, metabolic emissions of CH4 (although not CO2) from humans may play an increasing role in regional and global carbon budgets.},

@article{ch4,
	abstract = {Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas released to the atmosphere by various natural and anthropogenic sources. Numerous studies have been conducted to quantify the major and minor CH4 sources on spatial and temporal time scales. A minor source of the atmospheric global CH4 budget is the direct release of CH4 from the living human body. Based on available data from recent publications, for the first time, CH4 emissions from human breath and flatus are estimated on a global scale taking into account dominant factors influencing emission, such as age, ethnicity, and gender. Human CH4 emissions are compared between preindustrial times (1750), present age (2017) and future prediction (2100) using demographic data based on World Population Prospects 2017 of the United Nations (UN 2017). In preindustrial times the global CH4 release by humans is estimated at 34 $\pm$ 28 Gg and then substantially increase by a factor of ten reaching 344 $\pm$ 255 Gg by 2017. Emissions are estimated to further increase by almost fourfold to a value of 1221 $\pm$ 672 Gg by 2100, even though the rise in population is predicted to only increase by 50%. This nonlinear relationship is related to the predicted change in population structure affecting the number of CH4 producers. In contrast, for the year 2100 the simplified non-weighted estimation which merely considers the expected increase in population would only account for 612 $\pm$ 169 Gg. The discrepancy between the simplified non-weighted and weighted estimations of human CH4 emissions emphasises the importance of factor-based calculations in order to compile more accurate data.},

@article{fart_amount,
	abstract = {Abstract In addition to causing embarassment and unease, flatulence is linked to a variety of symptoms, some of which may be distressing. This review describes the origins of intestinal gas, its composition and methods which have been developed for its analysis. Emphasis is placed upon the effects of legumes in the diet in producing excessive intestinal gas and, particularly, on the role of raffinose-type oligosaccharides, containing α-galactosidic groupings. Suggestions for overcoming the problem are presented, including drug treatment, enzyme treatment, food processing and plant breeding. It is emphasised that removal of all raffinose-oligosaccharides from beans does not remove the problem of flatulence in animals and man; the compounds responsible --- though assumed to be polysaccharides (or polysaccharide-derived oligomers formed by processing or cooking) --- have yet to be characterised.},

@article{fart_concentration,
	abstract = {To better understand the physiology of colonic gas production, each flatus passage of 16 subjects over a 4-h period was analyzed by gas chromatography for N2, O2, H2, CO2, CH4, and for odoriferous sulfur-containing gases. Appreciable intraindividual and enormous interindividual variability was observed, indicating that each gas passage reflected the interaction of highly variable liberation and/or removal mechanisms. The predominant flatus gas was CO2, H2, and N2 in seven, six, and three subjects, respectively. Gases produced intraluminally (H2, CO2, and CH4) comprised approximately 74% of flatus, and rapid CO2 and H2 productions were responsible for high passage rates. A positive correlation between flatus H2 and CO2 suggested that CO2, like H2, mainly was a bacterial product. Whereas methanogens and H2S-producing bacteria usually are mutually exclusive in feces, CH4 and H2S did not negatively correlate, indicating coexistence of both organisms in the colon. We conclude that analysis of flatus composition provides a novel means of assessing colonic physiology, particularly ongoing bacterial metabolism throughout the unperturbed colon.},
