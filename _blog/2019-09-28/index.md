## Introduction
The past couple weekends, I've found myself in a mental state which is not quite refreshed enough to do serious work but also not quite lazy enough to do nothing all day.  I think a reasonable endeavor for me to embark on is to try to spend just an hour or two each weekend either doing projects or writing tutorials about random topics I have knowledge in.  By doing so, I hope to be able to help more people succeed in their projects and learn some things myself.  I've always wondered who were the heros who create those tutorials that have many-a-time saved my day, and I hope that one day something I write can save someone else's day.

This weekend, though, I've already spent a couple hours cleaning up the site so I'll start next week (hopefully that's not what I say every week...).
