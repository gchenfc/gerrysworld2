## Introduction
Shelves can be surprisingly expensive to buy online.  The cheapest ones I could find on Amazon were on the order of $30 and were only 3ft tall or so.  Being somewhat crafty, I thought I could do better with the added benefit of customizing the form factor and making the aesthetic match my taste preferences.  Here I detail how I you can make your own!  It's 5 feet tall with platforms every foot and the platforms are 1ft x 1ft.  It's surprisingly sturdy and cost around $20 to make.
